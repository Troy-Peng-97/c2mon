# What is OPC UA?

OPC UA is powerful and extensive machine-to-machine standard for process control and automation. The OPC family of 
standards has been widely successful in the automation industry, and remains cutting edge in automation environments. 
OPC UA as the newest addition to these standards offers a number of advantages over its predecessors, including:

* platform independence
* high reliability and redundancy
* enhanced performance
* comprehensive security model
* improved data modeling capabilities

C2MON offers an open source data acquisition module to easily monitor data points through OPC UA. 


# Learning by doing: Set up a C2MON instance to read from an open OPC UA server

C2MON can easily be configured to acquire data through OPC UA. This walkthrough details the necessary steps on the
 example of a server generating random data.
